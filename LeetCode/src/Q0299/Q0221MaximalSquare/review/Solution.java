    [Medium]
    Given an m x n binary matrix filled with 0's and 1's, find the largest square containing only 1's and return its
    area.

    Example 1:
    Input: matrix = [["1","0","1","0","0"],["1","0","1","1","1"],["1","1","1","1","1"],["1","0","0","1","0"]]
    Output: 4
    Input: matrix = [["0","1"],["1","0"]]
    Output: 1
    Example 3:

    Input: matrix = [["0"]]
    Output: 0
