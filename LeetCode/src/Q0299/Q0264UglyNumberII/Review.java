/*
    [Medium]
    An ugly number is a positive integer whose prime factors are limited to 2, 3, and 5.
    Given an integer n, return the nth ugly number.

    Example 1:
    Input: n = 10
    Output: 12
    Explanation: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12] is the sequence of the first 10 ugly numbers.

    Example 2:
    Input: n = 1
    Output: 1
    Explanation: 1 has no prime factors, therefore all of its prime factors are limited to 2, 3, and 5.
