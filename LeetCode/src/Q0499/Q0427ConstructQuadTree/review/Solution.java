    [Medium]
    Given a n * n matrix grid of 0's and 1's only. We want to represent the grid with a Quad-Tree.
    Return the root of the Quad-Tree representing the grid.
    Notice that you can assign the value of a node to True or False when isLeaf is False, and both are accepted in
    the answer.
