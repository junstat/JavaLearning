/*
    [Medium]
    Given a non-empty array nums containing only positive integers, find if the array can be partitioned into two
    subsets such that the sum of elements in both subsets is equal.

    Example 1:
    Input: nums = [1,5,11,5]
    Output: true
    Explanation: The array can be partitioned as [1, 5, 5] and [11].

    Example 2:
    Input: nums = [1,2,3,5]
    Output: false
    Explanation: The array cannot be partitioned into equal sum subsets.
