    Serialization is converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file
    or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or
    another computer environment.

    Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary search tree. There is no restriction on how your
    serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You need to ensure that a binary search tree can be
    serialized to a string, and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.

    The encoded string should be as compact as possible.

    Example 1:
    Input: root = [2,1,3]
    Output: [2,1,3]

    Example 2:
    Input: root = []
    Output: []

    // Encodes a tree to a single string.

    }

    // Decodes your encoded data to tree.
    public TreeNode deserialize(String data) {

        return null;
    }
}
