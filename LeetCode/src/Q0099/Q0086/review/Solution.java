/*
  [Medium]
  Given the head of a linked list and a value x,
  partition it such that all nodes less than x come before nodes greater than or equal to x.

  You should preserve the original relative order of the nodes in each of the two partitions.

  Example 1:
  Input: head = [1,4,3,2,5,2], x = 3
  Output: [1,2,2,4,3,5]
