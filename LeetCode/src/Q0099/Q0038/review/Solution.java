    Example 1:
    Input: n = 1
    Output: "1"
    Explanation: This is the base case.

    Example 2:
    Input: n = 4
    Output: "1211"
    Explanation:
    countAndSay(1) = "1"
    countAndSay(2) = say "1" = one 1 = "11"
    countAndSay(3) = say "11" = two 1's = "21"
    countAndSay(4) = say "21" = one 2 + one 1 = "12" + "11" = "1211"
