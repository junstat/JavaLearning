    Given the head of a singly linked list where elements are sorted in ascending order,
    convert it to a height balanced BST.
    For this problem, a height-balanced binary tree is defined as a binary tree in which
    the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differ by more than 1.

    Example 1:
    Input: head = [-10,-3,0,5,9]
    Output: [0,-3,9,-10,null,5]
    Explanation: One possible answer is [0,-3,9,-10,null,5], which represents the shown height balanced BST.

    Example 2:
    Input: head = []
    Output: []
