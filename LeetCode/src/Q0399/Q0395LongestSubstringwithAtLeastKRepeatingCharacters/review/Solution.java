/*
    [Medium]
    Given a string s and an integer k, return the length of the longest substring of s such that the frequency of
    each character in this substring is greater than or equal to k.

    Example 1:
    Input: s = "aaabb", k = 3
    Output: 3
    Explanation: The longest substring is "aaa", as 'a' is repeated 3 times.

    Example 2:
    Input: s = "ababbc", k = 2
    Output: 5
    Explanation: The longest substring is "ababb", as 'a' is repeated 2 times and 'b' is repeated 3 times.
